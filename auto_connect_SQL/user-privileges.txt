=====================Playing with User <- Role <- Privileges ===================

Step-4: for table space---------
->alter user xyz2 quota 500m on system;
Step-6: Now connect/login as xyz2
->connect
->username: xyz2
->password: xyz2
Step-7: Now create table, insert data, create view and check view

-> connect sys as sysdba
Step-9: Now we shall remove create view privileges/permission from user xyz2
-> revoke create view from manager;
